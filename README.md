# HWiNFO VSB Viewer
HWiNFO VSB Viewer is an application that will read the HWiNFO VSB registry values and display them in a grid. The Index values shown in the grid can then be used in Rainmeter skins.

This app gets the same information from the registry as the `reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\HWiNFO64\VSB` command and then puts it in an easy to use grid. 

For more information on using HWiNFO with Rainmeter, read this [https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/](https://docs.rainmeter.net/tips/hwinfo/)
